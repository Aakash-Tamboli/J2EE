### J2EE
J2EE is known as java to enterprise edition, where it is totally web-based project.

1) styleone - 
So In this Styleone web app I created HR Application Where I did just to make website means no Optmization No Standard Practice Just By hook or crook this App Should Work as in 90s era websites buit.

	Problems: Found in Style one
		1) Redundancy at client and server side
		2) If some problem occured hard to find who is wrong programer or designer.
	Possible Solution:
		1) File Sepration of js and styling.
		2) using jsp we can comprassed gap b/w programer and designer hence it help in product debugging
		3) using jsp we can design our page in moduler section like we break our website into modules and whenever we required we just include it using jsp tags.

2) styletwo - 
So In this Styletwo web app I again created HR application where I eliminate code redundancy using jsp and learn lot's of new concept such as beans,Tag Handler etc
