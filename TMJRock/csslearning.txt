Position: Absolute
Whenever we see website we always see as top view
Assume there is three cars line by line

car1 car2 car3

So When we se car2 as absoloute car2 Will float

	car2

car1		car3

hence car2 place is empty thats why car1 takes place

	car2

	car1 car3

So this is concept of Position : Absolute

More complexity about Positioning
again car examples

car1 car2 car3 without applying positioning


Now understand when we apply absolute positioning on car3 it will,
float at level 1 because its first element on display

similary when we apply absolute positioning on car2 it will float,
at level 2 because its second element on display

and so on that why if we apply on car1 it will float at level 3

Now we our all cars using positioning absolute then we as user see
car 1 becuase it is at top level hence always we as user whichever element
at top,

Position Relative

So when a element become position absolute, it will go out side its,
parent container

So if we want that element should not go outside its parent container.
so we add css property in parent as position relative.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Most Important Question
What if parent is set as relative
and its one of child is set as position absolute

Now I want that child also contains child where it should not go outside,
its thier parent

parent (set as relative) (Aakash)
	child (set as absolute) (Bittu)
	(someting)child(What do I set that it should not go out its parent)
			(Remember something should not go outside bittu)
			(because bittu is thier parent)

We don't need to do anything because Bittu is already absolute for thier
childrens so it also act like relative to its children.
